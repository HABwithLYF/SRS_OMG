1. Introduction
===============

1.1 Purpose
-----------
This document describes the design Little Hill Lab's initial requirements for an online application (Oh My Genes) which allows our scientists to upload gene expression files and quickly get differentially expressed genes., including the demand in function and performance.

The main purpose is identifying differentially expressed genes given a gene expression file containing two cell samples.

1.2 Scope
---------
This document is to derive a logical model of objective system from the one of current system, and answer the question of ¡°what to do¡± of this project .In this document , development techniques are not involved. The document is mainly to describe user¡¯s requirement by modeling, to build a communication bridge for clients, users, and developers.

1.3 User Characteristics
------------------------
**End-user** - Biologists who do some research about genetic analysis.
**Website maintainers** - workers who do website maintenance and development.

1.4 Overview
------------
The web application has a simple interface with a single button [Upload and GO]. Our scientists upload a plain text file containing gene expression levels from two samples, representing two experimental conditions. Accepting the file, the software will return a table of differentially expressed genes and a scatter plot of these genes whose X-axis is control and Y-axis is treatment. If an invalid gene expression is given, the web application returns a page informing the user to provide the correct format.

1.5 Glossaries
--------------
* **Control sample** - a cell sample prepared in its normal condition.
* **Treatment sample** - a cell sample treated by special chemicals, or in which some genes are altered.
* **Differentially expressed genes** - the genes which have significantly different expression levels between two samples.
* **Up-regulation** - a gene is said to be up-regulated if it has higher expression in treatment than in control.
* **logFC**- log fold change of gene expression. log_2 [T/C], where T is the gene expression level from a treatment sample, while C is the gene expression level from a control sample.
